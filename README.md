# 🐍 Py Road to Greatness

Welcome to my Python learning journey!  
This repository contains small projects I've built while studying the book **Python Crash Course (3rd Edition)** by Eric Matthes.

Each folder contains:
- Python scripts based on what I learned in that chapter
- Mini-projects that apply those concepts in creative ways

I'm using this repo to track my progress and grow as a Python developer, one project at a time.
